# The Dream Portal

 The Dream Portal is a web application developed to simplify the exchange of data between the Dream Project, and its students and supporters. Through the use of various APIs, this application connects everyone directly to our database hosted by Salesforce. The end result is a much smoother data collection process for the organization which saves time and money, and allows for easier access of certain statistics.

## Features

* Supporters and students are able to update their personal information
* Supporters and students are able to RSVP and volunteer for different events
* Students are able to apply, or renew, their scholarship through the online application portal
* People reviewing, or interviewing, applicants can access all relevant information directly from their browser
